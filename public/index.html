    <h1>Go Karting</h1>

    <p>
      A passion of mine has always been racing and go Karting is a hobby I
      enjoy. Karting is a very competitive sport and most profesionals have some
      background in go Karting. Karting is a sport you can get your whole family
      involved with. Kids can start racing in a club as young as four years old.

      I don't have my own go kart any more so i join leauge night races at
      rental kart facilities. Its also a more budjet friendly option and it
      saves me a lot of time from regular maintaince.
